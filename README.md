Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!

From numbers 0 through 100 this program will perform the following: for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
